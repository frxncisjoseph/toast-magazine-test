              Late on a midweek evening in winter, five years ago, I came to Euston station to begin
              a journey from London to the most westerly point on the British mainland. The station
              concourse was cold but wonderfully empty; low-lit and calm in contrast with the usual
              daytime scurry. Dispersed commuters stood silently before the departure board while a
              handful in suits waited at the counters of closing delis for end-of-night stodge. I
              bought a few travel provisions, found my platform and, with the vast train already
              arrived and being loaded, followed a long row of carriages to my cabin for the night.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="text-quote u-mt-3 u-mt-md-4">
              “The dome unsurprisingly failed to rise, and was was good-naturedly termed the the
              Supine Dome.”

              I was off to Fort William in the northwest of Scotland; the town that has for
              centuries served as a gateway to the Highlands and Islands. At Fort William I would
              pick up my rental car and drive on further west to Corran, catch a ferry across Loch
              Linnhe and continue on to the Ardnamurchan Peninsula—a finger tip of Britain pointing
              straight out across the ocean to America. These latter stages of the journey I
              apprehensively contemplated as my train left Euston in the dark; planned at the last
              minute I wasn’t entirely certain of their competent execution. Ferry times had been
              checked—but only at a glance—and I had been lucky to secure a hire car at such short
              notice. Although these were the days before Uber, Londoners tend to be guilty of
              assuming an ease with travel: however precarious the journey, there’s always a way to
              get where you want to get to, no matter how late in the day. Getting from London to
              Ardnamurchan, it seemed, wasn’t so straight forward. But then, why should it be?

              City lights receeded and London disappeared; a drink in the bar carriage, then to the
              quiet of the cabin, half a chapter of something, bed. I woke up, almost unbelievably,
              to imposing, picturesque hills and a passing loch. Early morning light plastered the
              little cabin window before the black out of a short tunnel. Back out by the water
              again, the view just stunning. Another tunnel fast approaching, its ferny bank
              powdered with snow—the first of the season, somewhere a long way from home.

              The purpose of the trip was to be interviewed for a head gardener position in the
              remote part of Scotland that lay at the end of my 550 mile journey. I’d not even stay
              the night, although two would be spent getting there and back again. The garden was a
              restoration project: an attractive landscape overrun with acidic shrubs and tatty
              exotic cordylines—the fancies of its former proprietor now waning with neglect. A new
              owner had acquired the estate with grand plans in mind, ready to inject life back into
              the overgrown grounds. I was at that time eager for exactly this sort of horticultural
              challenge, whichever end of the country it might turn up.

              At Fort William I woke fully in the sharp, clean air, further roused with coffee as I
              located the car in the station parking lot. Empty road to Corran, short wait for the
              ferry, off across the peninsula through a palette of deep greens, red and blazing
              ochre. A tour of the garden, followed by lengthy chats around a large oak table;
              decisions to be made, hands shaken. The interview occupied the first half of the day,
              which left the second free to explore as much of the surrounding countryside as I
              could before boarding the evening train home. Over the course of that afternoon, in
              bright winter sunshine, I sauntered in a cheerful daze from one place to another,
              meandering slowly along the road back to Fort William. I took in magnificent coastline
              and loch beaches, damp plantation woods and mossy rivers, long empty fields before
              cloud-tipped mountains. I tried to imagine what it would be like to call these places
              home, to root into the landscape like the sturdy local cattle with their heavy
              Highland coats. I questioned my hardiness and my ability to grow a beard; the terrain
              seemed to demand a resilience tough as gorse needles. ‘Expansive’ was a word that
              frequently came to mind also: each view as wonderfully unpopulated as, well, Euston
              station at midweek midnight. Room to breathe, room to think, landscapes to be lost in,
              yet find a train of thought.

              12 hours later I emerged from the cabin into Euston in full morning swing: queues at
              the barriers, queues on the concourse. Though in the end (and after days of
              deliberation) I had to decline the job, the brief trip marked a first of many to the
              highlands of Scotland. It was an introduction to this beautiful and remote part of
              Britain, a part I’ve grown fond of and need little excuse to visit. I’ve since found
              my way there via all means of transport, recently having flown for reasons specific to
              timing. Travel by train however, especially through the night, is by far the most
              preferable should one have the option. It’s certainly the most conducive to making an
              escape from the city: under the cover of darkness, carried off through the night. To
              greet from the pillow this bewilderingly uncluttered and dramatic landscape is a fine
              introduction; to wake up transported into the wide and wintery northwest.
